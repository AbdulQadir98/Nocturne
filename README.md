# Nocturne: real-time night time driving assistant

Welcome to the Nocturne: real-time night time driving assistant repository, a project designed to enhance safety during nighttime travel on Sri Lankan roads.

## Overview

This system predicts pedestrians, cyclists, and potholes in the Sri Lankan context during nighttime. It utilizes Python for data preprocessing and model training, React for the application frontend, and Spring Boot for the backend.

## Features

- **Real-Time Projection:** Immediate and vital information is projected onto the vehicle windscreen.
  
- **Network Establishment:** A network connects drivers based on their individual needs.

- **Prediction Focus:** Real-time detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and potholes during nighttime.

- **Pothole Data Logging:** Logging of pothole data for further analysis.

- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes parallel processing for efficient real-time detection.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Preprocessing and Model Training:** Python, YOLOv8 Ultralytics python library.
  
- **Application Development:** Android.

- **Backend Implementation:** Spring Boot, and Firebase.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulQadir98/Nocturne.git
